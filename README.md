## Hi There 🙋‍♂️

---

I'm Jeff, a self-taught Data Analyst and Storyteller currently in Florida.

⏱ Quick facts about me:

- 👨‍🎓 Graduated from THE Ohio State University with a Psychology degree
- 🏂 Lived in Colorado for 6 years after college before following family to Florida
- ✍ First became aware of and interested in Data Science while researching AI for the two books I wrote in a Sci-fi series (Sorry, they're not published yet!)
- 📖 I love reading both fiction and non-fiction, averaging about a book per week---or 3 this year, since I'm on pace for 150+ books. 🤯
- 👨‍🏫 I also love learning new things, from dabbling in Java, C, C++, and HTML/CSS over 10 years ago to more recently teaching myself SQL, R, Tableau, advanced Excel, and likely Python next.
- 🔢 I've fallen in love with data, and analyzing it. While I've previously dabbled in coding, I believe what's captivated me about analytics is churning through the data to find patterns and insights that tell a story, and data's stories never lie.
