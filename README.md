## Hi there 🙋‍♂️

---

I'm Jeff, a data literate Web Developer and Storyteller currently in Florida.

⏱ Quick facts about me:

- 👨‍🎓 Graduated from THE Ohio State University with a Psychology degree
- 📖 I love reading, both immersing myself in fiction and learning from non-fiction. Having read over 215 books in 2022🤯 and on pace for 150+ in 2023, it's almost gotten out of hand recently. 
- 🏂 Lived in Colorado for 6 years after college before following family to Florida
- ✍ Became deeply interested in Data Science while researching AI for a couple of books I wrote in a Sci-fi series during the pandemic.  
- 🔢 Interest in data bloomed into something more as I studied data analytics and became captivated by the stories data could tell after analyzing its patterns and insights. However, I eventually enjoyed the coding aspect more than anything else, inspiring a transition to an old flame from years past: Web Development.

- 👨‍🏫 As you can tell, I really love learning and trying new things, especially programming. From...
  - learning Java in high school
  - TO taking a handful of computer science classes in college
  - TO teaching myself HTML/CSS/JS, among others, shortly after college
  - TO learning SQL, R, Tableau, advanced Excel, and other tools for data analytics
  - TO now going full circle back to Web Development.
  - Getting paid to continuously learn and grow has always been a dream of mine.
- 👨‍💻 Now, I'm completing a Full Stack Web Development bootcamp through CareerFoundry to learn HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap, MongoDB, React, React Native, Angular, and many other tools to attain a full skillset and get the kind of job I've always wanted.
