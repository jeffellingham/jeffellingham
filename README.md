## Hi there 🙋‍♂️

---

I'm Jeff, a self-taught Data Analyst and Storyteller currently in Florida.

⏱ Quick facts about me:

- 👨‍🎓 Graduated from THE Ohio State University with a Psychology degree
- 🏂 Lived in Colorado for 6 years after college before following family to Florida
- ✍ First became aware of and interested in Data Science while researching AI for the two books I wrote in a Sci-fi series (Sorry, they're not published yet!)
- 📖 I love reading both fiction and non-fiction, averaging about a book per week---or 3 this year, since I'm on pace for 150+ books. 🤯
- 👨‍🏫 I also love learning new things, from dabbling in Java, C, C++, and HTML/CSS over 10 years ago to more recently teaching myself SQL, R, Tableau, advanced Excel, and likely Python next.
- 🔢 I've fallen in love with data, and analyzing it. While I've previously dabbled in coding, I believe what's captivated me about analytics is churning through the data to find patterns and insights that tell a story, and data's stories never lie.


💻 My Projects:

- Highlights from my [Kaggle Profile](https://www.kaggle.com/jeffellingham):
  - [Capstone Project for Google's Data Analytics Professional Certification](https://www.kaggle.com/code/jeffellingham/bellabeat-eda-project) --- This is the final
  deliverable from my first major project, which took me through every step of the analytics process. I developed potential growth opportunities and marketing strategies for Bellabeat, a health-focused smart device company for women, after gaining insights from an exploratory data analysis into a competitor's smart device data.
  - [Scraping and cleaning overall PPR fantasy football rankings](https://www.kaggle.com/code/jeffellingham/scraping-and-averaging-overall-ppr-rankings-2022) --- Scraped 15 websites of their experts' overall PPR rankings using R's rvest package. This Markdown journal walks through how I cleaned, prepped, and joined all the scraped data into one dataset for analysis and visualizations. The most challenging and enlightening part was definitely the cleaning aspect, because I used the players' names as keys for joining the data together and had tweak every single one to ensure they aligned.
  - [Overall PPR rankings dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jeffellingham/final-rankings-2022) --- The final deliverable of the above project, which I uploaded to Kaggle for others to use.
- Highlights from my [Tableau Profile](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jeff.ellingham):
  - [Toughest Sports](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jeff.ellingham/viz/ToughestSports-RankedbyExpertsAcross10Skills/Dashboard1) --- An exploratory dashboard I created using a #makeovermonday prompt where experts ranked 60 sports across 10 skills to determine the "toughest sports."
  - [Discount Policy Analysis presentation](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jeff.ellingham/viz/DiscountPolicyAnalysisStory_16638166254680/StoryofDiscountPolicyAnalysis) --- A Story Point presentation I created during the final course in UC Davis' Data Visualization with Tableau Specialization.
